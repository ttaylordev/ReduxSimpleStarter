every class we create must have a render method.

Two types of components
Class based

functional


# even handler is a function that rusn whenever an event occurs


#State 
 * a plain javascript object that is used to record and react to user events
 * each class based component has it's own state object
 * whenever a components state is changed, the component and all its' children rerender.
 * before we use it in a component we need to initialize the state object inside the class's constructor method.
